Welcome to the wintry realms!
Winds are ever-blowing. Blowing off the
glaciers.
Are you ready to face the challenges of the
icy north? Hunger, coldness, ravenous
beasts, glacial chasms and forthcoming
eternal winter are waiting for you in the
darkness.
`;

Texts.intro.chapter2 = `
You have come a long way from your homelands
seeking
the thrill of the adventure. Now, you must
fight freezing battles in
the north against hordes of winter demons
and blizzard beasts. Will you bring back the
peace
to the grim and frostbitten kingdoms. Or
will you
bring the Winter of Ages upon its lands,
reigning
your kingdom cold for all eternity? Or will
you
perish
nameless and forgotten on the icy wastes?
