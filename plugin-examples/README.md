Plugin examples for Battles
===========================

This folder contains some examples how to extend the Battles game functionality.
Plugins can be loaded after the game has been launched. 

Select `Plugin -> Load script` from the top menu. Then choose the plugin file
you want to load. After selecting the file, the Plugin Manager will appear
with the plugin UNLOADED. This means the file was evaluated properly and no
syntax errors were found.

To activate the plugin, you must tick the box under `Enabled` column. After
ticking the box, the status should change the LOADED. If not, something went
wrong when trying to load the plugin.
